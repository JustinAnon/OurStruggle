So, you want to contribute? Great! We'll help you get started.

## Basic Setup for Windows Users
- Go to https://github.com
  - Create an account
    - It will ask you for your username, email, and password.
    - It will ask you which plan (free or paid). 
      - Just choose the free plan.
    - It will also ask you to confirm your email.
- Go to https://desktop.github.com/ to download Github Desktop
  - Click download.
  - Run the program and follow the installation instructions.
  - When that is done, you will see a screen that says "Let's get started."
- In your browser
  - Go to https://github.com/JustinAnon/OurStruggle
  - Click the button that says "Fork" in the top right-hand corner.
  - You will now see your name and the project name in the top left-hand corner. BOOKMARK THIS PAGE
  - Click the green button on the right called "Clone or download"
  - Click the "Open in Desktop" button on the popup.
  - Click "Yes" when your browser asks you if you want to open this on your computer.
- In Github Desktop (that program you downloaded earlier)
  - You'll see something called "local path" which should have a path that resembles
    - "C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\Documents\GitHub\PROJECTNAME"
  - Remember that path because that is the location where the files for the project will be located.
  - Now, click the "Clone" button

At this point, you have all the files you need set up in "C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\Documents\GitHub\OurStruggle"
You can go look at them if you would like. When you are ready to make changes to these files, go to the next section.

## Making Changes

- In your file explorer
  - Go to that directory that you wrote down earlier
    - "C:\Users\[YOURNAME]\Documents\GitHub\OurStruggle"
  - You will see the files in the project there.
  - Make some changes to these files or add some new ones to this folder.
- Open Github Desktop
  - You should see the files you have changed on the left and the contents that you added or removed on the right.
  - If there are any mistakes that you see, go back to those files that you changed, fix them, and when you are ready come back here.
  - In the bottom right-hand corner, you will see two fields
    - The top one is the title of your change
    - The bottom one is a description of your changes
  - Make sure you fill these out properly so we know what you changed.
  - When you have filled out those fields, click the blue button called "Commit to master"
  - Now, on the right, you should see a button called "Push origin." Press that.
    - This moves your changes from your computer to Github
- Go to your browser
  - Go to that page we told you to bookmark earlier, it should look like https://github.com/[YOURNAME]/OurStruggle
  - Notice that your files are now in Github.
  - If you are ready to get your files into the REAL repository, click the button on the left called "New Pull Request"
  - Then click the green button called "Create pull request"
  - Head to https://github.com/JustinAnon/OurStruggle/pulls
    - If you see your name, Congratulations! We will look at your request shortly and either accept it into the real repository, or give you feedback on what you need to change.
